### Project Overview

This project tackles the challenge of fine-grained visual categorisation by classifying 200 different species of birds. The primary goal is to build and train a model that can accurately identify bird species from images.

---

### Dataset

The project uses the **Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 (CUB-200)** dataset. This dataset is a challenging image dataset containing photos of 200 bird species.

- **Total Species:** 200
- **Training Images:** 4,829

---

### Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using two primary metrics:

-   **Top-1 Accuracy:** The overall classification accuracy across all test images.
-   **Average Accuracy Per Class:** The average of accuracies for each individual bird species, providing insight into the model's performance on a per-class basis.
