| **Report** | **7 to >5.0 Pts Good** <br> Provide additional qualitative and quantitative results that demonstrate new ideas and discoveries and stand out from other students in the class. <br><br> **5 to >3.0 Pts Average** <br> Clear explanation of methodology and well-presented experimental results and analysis. <br><br> **3 to >1.0 Pts Fair** <br> Fair explanation of the methodology and lacks experimental results and analysis that support the rationale. <br><br> **1 to >0 Pts Poor** <br> The CNN approaches are not well described, preventing the tutor from understanding the context of the proposed methodology. Experimental results are missing and recommended evaluation metrics are not used. | 7 pts |
| **Video presentation** | **3 to >2.0 Pts Good** <br> Good presentation. Required information provided is standout from other students in the class. A very good and clear level of understanding of the CNN approaches deployed. <br><br> **2 to >1.0 Pts Average** <br> Good presentation. Required information is provided in a satisfactory manner. Some areas needed more detail. <br><br> **1 to >0 Pts Poor** <br> Poor presentation. Vague information provided. No clear validation of clarification. Unable to show understanding of the CNN approaches deployed. | 3 pts |
| **Model deployment and web application** | **3 to >2.0 Pts Full marks** <br> A good and outstanding Gradio design for an AI model application. <br><br> **2 to >1.0 Pts Average** <br> An average Gradio design with basic modules for an AI model application. <br><br> **1 to >0 Pts Poor** <br> Poor implementation of Gradio for an AI model application. | 3 pts |
| **AI modeling framework** <br> This element evaluates the design flow for the implementation of your network architecture, including data input, data pre-processing, data loader, model architecture, optimization function, metrics evaluation and training scheme. | **7 to >5.0 Pts Good** <br> A very good and strategised code implementation that takes into account the enhancement of the generalisation aspect of the model, and achieves outstanding accuracy. <br><br> **5 to >3.0 Pts Average** <br> An average, standard design of code implementation that is able to successfully train a model to achieve descent accuracy. <br><br> **3 to >1.0 Pts Fair** <br> Fair code implementation that fails to achieve descent model performance due to missing or incomplete modules in network architecture framework. <br><br> **1 to >0 Pts Poor** <br> Missing modules in the AI modeling framework, leading to model training failure. | 7 pts |
